learning to play the TROY game using self play and policy gradients actor
critic reinforcement learning algorithms

### results
after 3 hours of training, the model shows significant recognition of game
boundaries and tries to avoid itself by going in circles

- the leads are promising, but frankly, the training time for this algorithm is
  too slow for me, so i will be coming back to this problem to explore A3C,
  DDPG learning methods later

#### future work
- cythonize the code
- add more algorithms
- explore evolutionary strategy in this particular game (integrate my Evolve
  project with desTROY)
